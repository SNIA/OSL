# OSL; the SNIA's Open Source Liaison Group   
Open Source Liaison is a multi-vendor collaborative group for aligning open source projects with standards
SNIA embraces open source development and standards in a variety of ways. We work collaboratively with the open source community to address evolving requirements and to further open standards. 
To help drive this activity, SNIA has created an Open Source Liaison, a multi-vendor collaborative group that:
- Aligns open source projects with standards (for example a plugin for CNCF’s Container Storage Interface with SNIA Swordfish™ without changes to the API)
- Identifies gaps and overlaps between SNIA technical leadership and open source leaders; and wishes to promote communication and work that permits all to stay in sync on standards and open source initiatives
- Facilitates testing of open source implementations and compliance (ex: joint Plugfests that road test new features from the collaboration)
The Open Source Liaison is open to both SNIA and non-SNIA members. To join our mailing list, send an email to open-source-liaison-subscribe@snia.org (subject line and content not needed).
## Open Projects 
### Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) Reference Implementation
CDMI is an ISO/IEC International Standard that enables interoperability and portability of data stored in the cloud. CDMI addresses data storage services, data migration, and data security for private, hybrid and public cloud with a formal de jure standards-approved interface. The CDMI standard is designed to work alongside OpenStack Swift and Amazon S3 Models. The reference implementation is written in Java and is available in GitHub.
### Swordfish API Emulator 
The Swordfish API Emulator can emulate a Swordfish-based system statically or dynamically. Starting from an initial state described by mock-ups, the emulator can be used to emulate a Swordfish system responding to create/modify/delete operations in order to allow developers to model new Swordfish functionality, test clients, demonstrate Swordfish and other similar functions. 
Swordfish-basic-web-client
The Swordfish Basic Web Client can connect to one or more Swordfish services (including the Swordfish emulator), and present in a web UI frame the entire Swordfish hierarchy. The basic web client also provides basic capabilities to modify configurable Properties (as specified in the schema), as well as providing a basic interface to add or remove elements from the service through a Web UI.
### Swordfish-datadog-sample-dashboard-integration 
The Swordfish datadog sample dashboard integration provides a sample dashboard for the datadog monitoring service that can connect to a Swordfish services (including the Swordfish emulator), and provides an integration to the datadog UI. The sample dashboard integration provides connectivity to a Swordfish service, display of system capacity information and available capacity thresholds.
### Swordfish-powerBI-sample-dashboard-integration 
The Swordfish PowerBI sample dashboard integration provides a sample dashboard for the PowerBI data center monitoring system that can connect to a Swordfish service (including the Swordfish emulator), and provides an integration to the PowerBI UI. The sample dashboard integration provides connectivity to a Swordfish service, display of system capacity information and available capacity thresholds.
